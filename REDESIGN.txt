PCB Re-Design Plans

1. Fix the MUXes to make all 64 devices accessible.
2. Add 100 to 220 ohm resistors to any PCB trace that could conceivably carry very high current during a short circuit.
3. Add jumpers to VGS so that there can be (a) direct connection from Master PSoC to specific socket pin (b) connection from Master PSoC to a MUX and (c) direct connection from specfic socket pin to IPEX.
4. Improve naming conventions to make things easier for more people to understand.
5. Double check naming conventions of Back/Local/Solution gates to make sure the socket pin locations are the same as blue board
6. Add resistors in known locations that are 1 kOhm, 10 kOhm, 100 kOhm, 1 MOhm, 10 MOhm
